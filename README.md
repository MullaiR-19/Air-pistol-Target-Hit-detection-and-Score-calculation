# Air-pistol-Target-Hit-detection-and-Score-calculation

This project is an air pistol target hit detection and scoring system developed using Python, OpenCV (CV2), and Arduino. It offers a comprehensive solution for target shooting enthusiasts. The system precisely identifies hit locations on the target sheet, calculates scores, and dynamically adjusts the target sheet position using a stepper motor controlled by Arduino. Whether for practice or competition, this system ensures accurate and efficient scorekeeping for air pistol shooting. 

Key Features:
- Hit detection with OpenCV for precision
- Real-time score calculation
- Arduino-controlled target sheet adjustments
- Ideal for both practice and competitive shooting
